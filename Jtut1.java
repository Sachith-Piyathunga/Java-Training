/**
 *      -- Java Garbage Collection
 * 
 * The Java Garbage Collector (GC) is an automatic memory management system within 
 * the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Its primary function is to automatically reclaim 
 * memory occupied by objects that are no longer referenced by the running Java 
 * application, thus preventing memory leaks and simplifying memory management for 
 * developers.
 * 
 *      -- class
 * In Java, a class serves as a blueprint or a template for creating objects. 
 * It defines the structure and behavior that objects of that class will possess.
 *  Instances of a class are objects
