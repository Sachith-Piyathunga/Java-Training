/**
 * Practice the question for the interview
 * 1. How do you reverse a string in Java?
 *      - There is no reverse() utility method in the String class. However, you can 
 *        create a character array from the string and then iterate it from the end 
 *        to the start. You can append the characters to a string builder and 
 *        finally return the reversed string.
